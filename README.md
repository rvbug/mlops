# MLOPs - ML in Prod


Yes, you have the best model in jupyter notebook and it is time to put this in production.


## But Why... 
Why another repo - It is my way of giving it back to the commuinity - especially beginners who are lost as I was 

## Pre-requisites
Before starting, some pre-requisites are

-  `mlops Repo` on Github  - Repository to version your code
-  `github profile & page` - Create a profile and free github page to showcase your work
-  `Hashnode` (chosen over Medium) - For Documenting and blogging my journey. Moved due to Medium's limitation, Hashnode seems to be promising.
-  `Docusaurus` (choosen over MKDocs) - MKDocs is a static file generator &  Docusaurus is built on top of React. There are lot of tools to work on, you will come across some cool tips & tricks, so need a place to note it down for future reference.
- `Markdown` - Markup language used for text formatting, this will help you in creating beautiful documentation 
- `YAML` - Most configurations use this markup language. It is now an industry standard
- `python` (chosen over R) - Most widely used for Data science and ML
