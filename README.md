# MLOPs - ML in Prod


Yes, you have the best model in jupyter notebook and it is time to put this in production.


## But Why... 
Why another repo - It is my way of giving it back to the commuinity - especially beginners who are lost as I was 

## Pre-requisites
(Feel free to select what you are comfortable with - these are my options only and I feel the technology & tools chooses you ;)
Before starting, some pre-requisites are :-

-  `git & github` - No kidding!!
-  `Linux` - Absolute must 
-  `mlops Repo` on Github  - Repository to version your code
-  `github profile & page` - Create a profile and free github page to showcase your work
-  `Hashnode` (chosen over Medium) - For Documenting and blogging my journey. Moved due to Medium's limitation, Hashnode seems to be promising.
-  `Docusaurus` (choosen over MKDocs) - You will come across lots of tools. This will help in documenting your journey, tips & tricks
-  `Markdown` - Markup language used for text formatting, this will help you in creating beautiful documentation 
-  `YAML` - Most configurations use this markup language. It is now an industry standard
-  `python` (chosen over R) - Most widely used for Data science and ML
-  `ML libraries` - sklearn, numpy, pandas , matplotlib, seaborn, Tensorflow/Pytorch
-  `jupyter notebook` - To run your experiements
