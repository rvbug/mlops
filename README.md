# MLOPs - ML in Prod


Yes, you have the best model in jupyter notebook and it is time to put this in production. MLOPs is a practise to productionize and monitor your models


## But Why... 
Why another repo - Sharing and documenting my learnings as I go along. Hopefully it will help someone who are as lost as I was.

## Pre-requisites
(Feel free to select what you are comfortable with - these are my options only and I feel the technology & tools chooses you ;)
Before starting, some pre-requisites are :-

-  `git, github & a repo` - No kidding!! To version your code
-  `Linux` - Any distro but an Absolute must 
-  `github profile & page` - Create a profile and free github page to showcase your work
-  `HTML, CSS, JS` - Create your static website 
-  `ReactJS` - If you want to have a dynamic website 
-  `Hashnode` - (chosen over Medium) - For Documenting and blogging my journey. Moved due to Medium's limitation, Hashnode seems to be promising.
-  `MKDocs or Docusaurus` - Static website generator or use Docusaurus with ReactJs.
-  `Markdown` - Markup language used for text formatting, this will help you in creating beautiful documentation 
-  `YAML` - Most configurations use this markup language. It is now an industry standard
-  `python` - (chosen over R) - Most widely used for Data science and ML
-  `pipenv` - (chosen over conda) - For creating virtual environment 
-  `Makefile` - A utility to define & execute set of tasks and their dependencies
-  `ML libraries` - sklearn, numpy, pandas , matplotlib, seaborn, Tensorflow/Pytorch
-  `jupyter notebook` - To run your experiements
-  `pycharm` (chosen over VSCode) - never could conect with VSCode 


# Journey
- `template.py` (Chosen over CookieCutter for DataScience) - set of folders and files to be created via python script, using my on version for better control
- `Docker` - 
- `Kubernetes` - 
- `DVC`
- `Hydra`
- `Tensorflow or Pytorch`
- `ONNX`
- `MLFlow`
- `Gihub Action`
- `Prometheus`
- `Grafana`
- `neo4j`
